# Accessibility Compliance Report

## WCAG 2.1 AA and AODA Compliance Implementation

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the MapleCatch application to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) guidelines.

## Key Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- **Proper heading hierarchy**: H1 for main page title, H2 for section headings, H3 for subsection headings
- **Semantic landmarks**: `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`
- **Role attributes**: Added appropriate ARIA roles for navigation, contentinfo, banner, etc.

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

- **Skip links**: Added "Skip to main content" link for keyboard users
- **Focus management**: Proper focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **Tab order**: Logical tab sequence throughout the application
- **Focus trapping**: Mobile menu properly traps focus when open

### 3. Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA labels**: Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- **ARIA attributes**: `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-current`, `aria-labelledby`
- **Alt text**: Comprehensive alt text for all images
- **Screen reader only content**: Hidden headings for navigation context

### 4. Visual Accessibility

- **Color contrast**: Improved contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus rings on all focusable elements
- **High contrast mode**: CSS media queries for high contrast preferences
- **Reduced motion**: Respects user's motion preferences

### 5. Mobile Accessibility

  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  /* ... */

- Test with WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)

### Manual Testing

- **Keyboard navigation**: Test all functionality using only keyboard
- **Screen reader testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
- **Color contrast**: Verify contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- **Mobile testing**: Test on various mobile devices and screen readers

### User Testing

- Test with actual users who rely on assistive technologies
- Gather feedback on navigation and content comprehension
- Test with users who have different types of disabilities
